Star Wars Game:

This is a small game where a player chooses a character and fights the rest of the characters available by clicking on the attack button.  

Directions:  

<ul>
<li>Click Start Game</li>
<li>Choose Character</li>
<li>Choose Opponent</li>
<li>Click Attack until someone dies</li>
<li>If alive choose another opponent/ If dead then restart</li>
</ul>

Not much going on in the game but maybe I'll play with this code again.

This little game is written using Javascript, Jquery, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS
